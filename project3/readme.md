This project really told me what I didn't know and the breadth of many languages, so I am hoping to strengthen those skills as I move forward. I also did this with flask, and oh my gosh, it was so much more intuitive for me. Even though I spent the most time on the nodeJS portion for project three, NodeJS continues to keep me awake at night and give me nightmares, but nonetheless I learned a lot.

The big caveat or downfall of using heroku is that each time a form gets submitted, it overwrites the global variable of the form input that gets sent, which will change the parameters that the scraper depends on to fetch the ETA. So, essentially only one person can use it at a time, but I just wanted to throw it on heroku for the laughs. Probably not the best idea to deploy a webscraper there either I'd imagine.
